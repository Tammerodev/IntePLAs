# INTRO

Inteplas is a 2D "voxel" based destruction platformer.


# Installing
The install will vary on different operating systems. Only linux is supported
for now.
## LINUX - INSTALL
1) Download the repo to your machine.
2) Unzip / uncompress the folder.
3) In the uncompressed folder, you should find a folder named "Scripts"
4) Run install.sh in the terminal as sudo
5) Go to the "output" folder, and execute the file named "Game".

## Troubleshooting : 
### Errors regarding cpu architecture :
    Compile the project on your machuine and try again.

### Executing "Game" doesnt open a folder :
    Run in the terminal to see error messages.
    If it still doesnt run, you may have to set "Run files as executables" flag to true.
